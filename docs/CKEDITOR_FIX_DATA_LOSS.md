# 🔧 FIX: CKEditor Data Loss When Switching Sections

## ❌ **The Problem**

User reported:
> "I supply the content of section 1, now I go to section 2 to supply the content in editor, when I go back to section 1 all the data I supplied is gone"

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

CKEditor component was **missing a `key` prop**. Without it:

1. User types in Section 1 → Content saved to state ✅
2. User clicks Section 2 → **React reuses the same CKEditor instance**
3. CKEditor doesn't reload with new data
4. User sees Section 2 (empty) but editor still shows Section 1's content
5. User clicks Section 1 → CKEditor still has old reference
6. ❌ **Data appears lost!**

**Why?** React doesn't know the sections are different without a unique `key`.

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

### **Added `key` Prop:**

```typescript
<CKEditorContentEditor
  key={section.id}  // ⭐ Forces remount when section changes
  data={section.content_data?.text || ''}
  onChange={(content) => { ... }}
/>
```

**How it works:**
- When you switch sections, `section.id` changes
- React sees different `key` value
- React **destroys old CKEditor instance**
- React **creates new CKEditor instance** with new data
- ✅ **Correct content loads!**

---

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Test 1: Basic Section Switching**

1. **Open browser console (F12)**

2. **Add Section 1:**
   - Click "Add Section"
   - Click on "Section 1"
   
   **Console should show:**
   ```javascript
   📂 Loading Section 1: {
     sectionId: "abc123",
     hasText: false,
     textLength: 0,
     textPreview: "(empty)"
   }
   
   🎯 CKEditor Component Mounted: {
     hasData: false,
     dataLength: 0,
     dataPreview: "(empty)"
   }
   
   ✅ CKEditor is ready!
   ```

3. **Type in Section 1:**
   - Type: "This is section 1 content"
   
   **Console should show:**
   ```javascript
   📝 CKEditor onChange: {
     contentLength: 31,
     hasContent: true,
     preview: "<p>This is section 1 content</p>"
   }
   
   💾 Auto-saving Section 1: {
     sectionId: "abc123",
     contentLength: 31,
     hasContent: true,
     preview: "<p>This is section 1 content</p>"
   }
   ```

4. **Add Section 2:**
   - Click "Add Section"
   - Click on "Section 2"
   
   **Console should show:**
   ```javascript
   📂 Loading Section 2: {
     sectionId: "xyz789",  ← Different ID!
     hasText: false,
     textLength: 0,
     textPreview: "(empty)"
   }
   
   🧹 Cleaning up Editor.js instance  ← Old editor destroyed
   
   🎯 CKEditor Component Mounted: {  ← New editor created
     hasData: false,
     dataLength: 0,
     dataPreview: "(empty)"
   }
   
   ✅ CKEditor is ready!
   ```

5. **Type in Section 2:**
   - Type: "This is section 2 content"
   
   **Console should show:**
   ```javascript
   📝 CKEditor onChange: {
     contentLength: 31,
     hasContent: true,
     preview: "<p>This is section 2 content</p>"
   }
   
   💾 Auto-saving Section 2: {
     sectionId: "xyz789",
     contentLength: 31,
     hasContent: true,
     preview: "<p>This is section 2 content</p>"
   }
   ```

6. **Click back to Section 1:**
   
   **Console should show:**
   ```javascript
   📂 Loading Section 1: {
     sectionId: "abc123",
     hasText: true,        ← ✅ Data exists!
     textLength: 31,       ← ✅ Has content!
     textPreview: "<p>This is section 1 content</p>"
   }
   
   🧹 Cleaning up Editor.js instance  ← Section 2 editor destroyed
   
   🎯 CKEditor Component Mounted: {  ← Section 1 editor created
     hasData: true,         ← ✅ Has data!
     dataLength: 31,
     dataPreview: "<p>This is section 1 content</p>"
   }
   
   ✅ CKEditor is ready!
   ```

7. **✅ VERIFY:**
   - Editor shows: "This is section 1 content"
   - **No data loss!**

---

### **Test 2: Multiple Sections**

1. **Add 3 sections with different content:**
   - Section 1: "First section"
   - Section 2: "Second section"
   - Section 3: "Third section"

2. **Switch between them randomly:**
   - Click Section 2 → Shows "Second section" ✅
   - Click Section 1 → Shows "First section" ✅
   - Click Section 3 → Shows "Third section" ✅
   - Click Section 2 → Shows "Second section" ✅

3. **✅ VERIFY:**
   - All sections preserve their content
   - No data loss

---

### **Test 3: Rich Content**

1. **In Section 1, add:**
   - Heading (H2): "My Heading"
   - Paragraph with **bold** and *italic*
   - Bulleted list
   - Image

2. **Switch to Section 2**

3. **Switch back to Section 1**

4. **✅ VERIFY:**
   - All formatting preserved
   - Image still there
   - Lists intact
   - **No data loss!**

---

## 📊 **Before vs After**

### **Before (No `key` prop):**

```typescript
<CKEditorContentEditor
  data={section.content_data?.text || ''}
  onChange={...}
/>
```

**Result:**
- ❌ Same component instance reused
- ❌ Data doesn't reload
- ❌ Content appears lost

---

### **After (With `key` prop):**

```typescript
<CKEditorContentEditor
  key={section.id}  // ⭐ Unique key
  data={section.content_data?.text || ''}
  onChange={...}
/>
```

**Result:**
- ✅ New component instance per section
- ✅ Data reloads correctly
- ✅ No data loss!

---

## 🔍 **How to Debug**

### **If data loss still occurs, check console:**

**Look for:**

1. **When clicking Section 1 back:**
   ```javascript
   📂 Loading Section 1: {
     hasText: true,    ← Should be TRUE
     textLength: 31,   ← Should have length
     textPreview: "..."  ← Should show content
   }
   ```

   **If `hasText: false`:**
   - ❌ Data not saved to state
   - Check `updateContentSection` function
   - Check `onChange` is firing

2. **When CKEditor mounts:**
   ```javascript
   🎯 CKEditor Component Mounted: {
     hasData: true,     ← Should be TRUE
     dataLength: 31,    ← Should match saved length
     dataPreview: "..."  ← Should show content
   }
   ```

   **If `hasData: false`:**
   - ❌ Data not passed to component
   - Check `section.content_data?.text` in parent
   - Check props are correct

3. **When typing:**
   ```javascript
   💾 Auto-saving Section 1: {
     contentLength: 31,  ← Should be > 0
     hasContent: true    ← Should be TRUE
   }
   ```

   **If `contentLength: 0`:**
   - ❌ CKEditor onChange not firing
   - Check CKEditor license key
   - Check CKEditor config

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

After implementing the fix, verify:

- [ ] `key={section.id}` prop is on CKEditorContentEditor
- [ ] Console shows "Cleaning up" when switching sections
- [ ] Console shows "Component Mounted" with correct data
- [ ] Section 1 content preserved after switch
- [ ] Section 2 content preserved after switch
- [ ] Multiple sections all work independently
- [ ] Rich formatting preserved
- [ ] Images preserved
- [ ] No console errors

## 🎯 **Why This Works**

### **React's Reconciliation:**

React uses the `key` prop to identify which component is which:

**Without `key`:**
```
Section 1 selected → <CKEditor /> rendered
Section 2 selected → Same <CKEditor /> reused (React optimization)
                      Props update but component doesn't remount
                      CKEditor internal state doesn't reset
Section 1 selected → Same <CKEditor /> reused again
                      ❌ Shows wrong content
```

**With `key`:**
```
Section 1 selected → <CKEditor key="abc123" /> rendered
Section 2 selected → <CKEditor key="xyz789" /> created
                      Different key = React knows it's different
                      Old component destroyed
                      New component created with fresh state
Section 1 selected → <CKEditor key="abc123" /> created again
                      ✅ Loads correct content
```

## 📝 **Summary**

### **The Fix:**
```typescript
// Add this one line:
key={section.id}
```

### **Result:**
- ✅ Data persists when switching sections
- ✅ Each section has independent editor
- ✅ Clean component lifecycle
- ✅ Reliable auto-save

### **Why It Works:**
- Forces React to create new component instance
- CKEditor initializes with correct data
- No state pollution between sections
