## 📝 Registration Data Collection

### Fields Collected:
```typescript
REQUIRED:
- Email (validated format)
- Password (min 6 chars)
- Confirm Password (must match)
- First Name
- Last Name
- Role (Student/Teacher)

OPTIONAL:
- Middle Name
- Grade Level (students only)
```

### Validation Schema (Zod):
```typescript
{
  firstName: min(1),
  lastName: min(1),
  email: email(),
  password: min(6),
  confirmPassword: matches password,
  role: enum(['student', 'teacher']),
  gradeLevel: optional(),
  middleName: optional()
}
```

---

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. User Registration (`/auth/register`)
- Select role (Student/Teacher tabs)
- Fill personal information
- Submit form

### 2. Client Validation
- React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Real-time field validation
- Password matching check

### 3. API Call (`AuthAPI.register()`)
**Creates two records:**

**a) Supabase Auth User:**
```typescript
auth.signUp({
  email, password,
  options: { data: { first_name, last_name, role, ... }}
})
```

**b) Profile Record:**
```typescript
profiles.insert({
  id: auth_user_id,
  email, first_name, middle_name, last_name,
  role, grade_level,
  onboarding_completed: FALSE  // ← Triggers onboarding
})
```

### 4. Auto Sign-In
```typescript
auth.signInWithPassword(email, password)
// User immediately authenticated
```

### 5. Role-Based Redirect

**TEACHER:**
```
→ /teacher/dashboard (onboarding skipped)
```

**STUDENT:**
```
→ /onboarding/vark (VARK assessment)
```

## 🎓 VARK Assessment (Students Only)

### Assessment Structure:
- **20 questions** (5 per learning style)
- **5-point Likert scale** (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
- **4 categories:** Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, Kinesthetic

### Question Categories:

| Category | Count | Questions |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Visual (V) | 5 | Q1, Q5, Q9, Q13, Q17 |
| Auditory (A) | 5 | Q2, Q6, Q10, Q14, Q18 |
| Kinesthetic (K) | 5 | Q3, Q7, Q11, Q15, Q19 |
| Reading/Writing (R/W) | 5 | Q4, Q8, Q12, Q16, Q20 |

### Sample Questions:
```
Q1 (Visual): "I prefer to learn through animations and videos..."
Q2 (Auditory): "I prefer to learn by listening to instructions..."
Q3 (Kinesthetic): "I prefer to learn when I can participate actively..."
Q4 (Reading/Writing): "I prefer to learn through reading detailed discussions..."
```

### Rating Scale:
```
1 = Strongly Disagree 😞
2 = Disagree 😐
3 = Undecided 🤷
4 = Agree 😊
5 = Strongly Agree 🎉
```

### Score Calculation:
```typescript
// Sum ratings for each category
scores = {
  visual: sum(Q1, Q5, Q9, Q13, Q17),
  auditory: sum(Q2, Q6, Q10, Q14, Q18),
  kinesthetic: sum(Q3, Q7, Q11, Q15, Q19),
  reading_writing: sum(Q4, Q8, Q12, Q16, Q20)
}

// Dominant style = highest score
dominantStyle = max(scores)
```

### Example Calculation:
```
Visual: 5+4+5+5+4 = 23
Auditory: 4+3+4+3+4 = 18
Reading/Writing: 3+3+4+3+3 = 16
Kinesthetic: 5+5+5+5+4 = 24  ← Winner!

Result: Kinesthetic Learner 🖐️
```

### Learning Styles:

**Visual (👁️):**
- Learns through seeing and observing
- Prefers pictures, diagrams, charts

**Auditory (🎧):**
- Learns through listening and speaking
- Prefers discussions, lectures

**Reading/Writing (✍️):**
- Learns through reading and writing
- Prefers text-based materials, notes

**Kinesthetic (🖐️):**
- Learns through movement and hands-on
- Prefers physical activities, experiments

### Save Results:
```typescript
updateProfile({
  learning_style: dominantStyle,      // e.g., "kinesthetic"
  onboarding_completed: true
})

→ Redirect to /student/dashboard
```
