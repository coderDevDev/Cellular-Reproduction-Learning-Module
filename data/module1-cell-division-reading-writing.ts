Cell Division

Cell division is an important biological process where one parent cell splits to create two or more new cells, called daughter cells.

The cells multiply through two different types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Each type plays an important role in growth, repair, and reproduction of every living organism.

Understanding what cell division is, is just the beginning. So let us explore its importance!`

1. Growth and Development
   - It helps organisms grow and form new tissues
   - How does it happen?
   - As the cells divide through mitosis, they produce new cells that are genetically identical. These new cells add to body size and help form tissues like muscles, bones, and skin.
   - Example: Imagine a baby, it continuously grows into a child because cells keep dividing and multiplying.

2. Repair and Regeneration
   - It replaces damaged or worn-out cells
   - How does it happen?
   - Imagine getting a cut or wound, the skin cells around the wound or cut divide to replace the lost and damaged skins.

3. Reproduction
   - It allows organisms to produce offspring or create new life
   - How does it happen?
   - There are different types of reproduction in which cell division plays an important role.
   - For example, in asexual reproduction, one parent cell divides to form offspring (e.g., bacteria through binary fission). While in sexual reproduction, special cells called gametes (sperm and egg) are made through meiosis. These gametes combine during fertilization to form a zygote, which grows into a new organism.`

The cell cycle has two major stages:

1. Interphase ‚Äì the time between cell divisions
2. Mitotic Phase ‚Äì the stage when the cell actually divides

Interphase

Interphase is the first and longest period between mitotic divisions that have 3 subphases such as G1, S, and G2.

G1 Phase (Gap 1)
This is the first part of interphase, where the cell grows and gets ready to divide. It builds up the materials and energy needed for the next steps.

S Phase (Synthesis)
During this phase, the cell copies all of its DNA. "S" stands for synthesis, which means making or building. This ensures that each new cell will have a complete set of genetic instructions.

G2 Phase (Gap 2)
In G2, the cell checks the copied DNA and begins organizing and condensing the genetic material. It prepares everything needed for division, making sure there's a full extra set of chromosomes.

Mitotic Phase (M Phase)

After interphase, the cell enters the M phase, which stands for mitosis. In this stage, the two complete sets of genetic material are separated into two new cells (Notes: That Mitosis stage includes stages such as prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase and cytokinesis, to complete the division of cells.)

Once mitosis is finished, the cell divides, leaving behind two daughter cells. These cells may either continue growing or begin the cycle again.

What Happens After Division?
After the cell divides and has fully matured, it either stops growing or divides to make more cells. This process helps the body grow, repair damaged tissues, and increase the number of cells when needed.`

          text: `Mitosis

Mitosis is a type of cell division that produces two (2) daughter cells having the same genetic material as its parent. The daughter cells have the same diploid chromosome number as the parent cell. The main purpose of this process is to help multicellular organisms grow, heal injuries, and reproduce without needing a partner (asexual reproduction).

Stages of Mitosis

Stage 1 - Prophase
This phase occupies over half of mitosis. The cell prepares for cell division by copying the DNA and the nuclear membrane and nucleolus are starting to break down in this process. Chromatin condenses into chromosomes. A centromere binds the double-stranded chromosomes together at one point. Spindle fibers begin to form, which are microscopic protein structures that help divide the genetic material in the cell.

Stage 2 - Metaphase
At the equator of the cell known as Metaphase plate, the now double stranded chromosomes called chromatids align themselves. Each chromatid is connected to the spindle by a structure called kinetochore in the centromere.

Stage 3 - Anaphase
This is the shortest stage. The chromatids are pushed by forces originating from the poles to pass. Consequently, the centromere divides into new, single-stranded chromosomes, splitting the chromatids. After that, the chromosomes travel towards their respective poles.

Stage 4 - Telophase
During this stage, the opposite poles have now reached the chromosomes, and the spindle fibers disappear. The chromosomes uncoil at the poles and the nucleolus and nuclear membrane start reforming. But the cell is not yet completely separated.

Cytokinesis
To complete the cell division after stages of mitosis, a process called cytokinesis takes place. In this process, the cytoplasm simultaneously divides, and the cell is separated into two by a plasma membrane. The formation of the new plasma membrane completely divides the cell, forming two identical daughter cells.

Cytokinesis happens differently between the animal and plant cells.

In animal cells, the creation of a cleavage furrow is necessary for cytokinesis, where the cytoplasm divides and the parent cell becomes two daughter cells. It pinches the cell off or splits it into two.

In plant cells, cells do not pinch off. Instead, between the two nuclei, a new structure called the cell plate forms to develop into a new cell wall.`

          text: `Meiosis

Meiosis is a special type of cell division that takes place in cells with two sets of chromosomes known as diploid cells (2n). It creates four genetically unique daughter cells called gametes (sperm cells in male and egg cells in females). These gametes carry only one set of chromosomes (haploid cells = n) which is half the number of chromosomes found in the parent cell. This process includes one round of DNA replication, followed by two cycles of division: Meiosis I and Meiosis II.

Meiosis I: First Division

It is the first round of cell division in meiosis. This stage starts after DNA replication and reduces the number of chromosomes by half meaning it changes one diploid cell (2n) that contains two sets of chromosomes into two haploid cells each containing only one set of chromosomes (n).

Stages of Meiosis I

Stage 1 - Prophase I
In this stage, the chromosomes have already been duplicated. Each chromosome is made up of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere. The homologous chromosomes (one from each parent) pair up in a process called synapsis, forming structures called tetrads (four chromatids in total, which two from each homologous chromosomes). While in this position, the process known crossing-over occurs, where genetic material is exchanged between homologous chromosomes, increasing genetic variation.

Stage 2 - Metaphase I
During this stage, the tetrads (paired homologous chromosomes) line up along the equatorial plate also known as Metaphase Plate. Their arrangement is random, contributing to genetic diversity.

Stage 3 - Anaphase I
The homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles. The direction each chromosome moves is random and does not depend on its partner.

Stage 4 - Telophase I and Cytokinesis
The chromosomes reached the opposite poles and a new nuclear membrane formed. To complete the division of cells the cell goes through the process of cytokinesis, forming two haploid daughter cells (n), in which contains one chromosome from each homologous pair, resulting in a haploid chromosome number.

After meiosis I it will undergo the second round of meiosis known as meiosis II.

Meiosis II: Second Division

It is the second round of cell division in meiosis. In this round, there is no DNA replication involved. This process is similar to mitosis where the separation of the sister chromatid occurs. However, this process starts with two haploid cells that are formed in meiosis I. These cells divide forming four haploid daughter cells. Each cell contains one complete set of chromosomes.

Stage 1 - Prophase II
Prophase II begins after Telophase I and cytokinesis; no DNA replication occurs. Sister chromatids remain attached at the centromere and the nuclear membrane breaks down.

Stage 2 - Metaphase II
During this stage, the chromosomes line up individually along the equatorial plate known as metaphase plate.

Stage 3 - Anaphase II
The centromeres split, and sister chromatids are pulled to opposite poles of the cell.

Stage 4 - Telophase II and Cytokinesis
In this stage the chromatids move to the opposite poles of the cell and the nuclear envelope is formed. After, the cytokinesis occurs where the cell division is completed. In which, a total of four haploid cells are produced, each containing single-stranded chromosomes. These cells are now ready to function as gametes (sperm or egg cells).`

          text: `Importance of Meiosis in Life Cycle of Animals

Meiosis helps animals make special cells called gametes. These are the egg cells in females and sperm cells in males. These cells are important for reproduction.

During fertilization, an egg and a sperm join together to form a zygote. This zygote has two sets of chromosomes‚Äîone from the mother and one from the father. In humans, each parent gives 23 chromosomes, so the zygote ends up with 46 chromosomes. The zygote then divides many times and grows into a new organism.

Meiosis in Males
Sperm cells are made in the testes. Meiosis creates four small sperm cells, all the same size.
Each sperm has:
- A head with the nucleus (where the DNA is stored)
- A middle part with mitochondria (which give energy)
- A tail that helps it swim

Meiosis in Females
Egg cells are made in the ovaries.
Meiosis makes one big egg cell and tiny cells that break down.
The big egg keeps nutrients to help the baby grow. The sperm only gives its DNA when it joins with the egg.`
